Arduino HID Project 2.1
=======================
![Header Picture](header.jpg)

This project went through a lot of phases and has now reached a new Arduino USB-Core
with a lot of new functions like extended HID. It also supports HoodLoader1+2.
The idea is to enable enhanced USB functions to almost all 'standard' Arduino boards.


Download
========

You have 3 versions you can download:
* The master includes all fixes to the current stable release. Download it by clicking download at the right.
Use the [online Wiki](https://github.com/NicoHood/HID/wiki) to get the newest documentation.
* Download an offline version in [releases](https://github.com/NicoHood/HID/releases).
It's a snapshot of the current stable release but might have missed some updates that the current master branch has included.
This also includes an offline version of the wiki. Offline versions will be available after some time when the official release is out.
* Select [branch 'dev'](https://github.com/NicoHood/HID/tree/dev) to test the bleeding edge of this software. It might now work at all or has a lot of debugging stuff in it.
If the dev version gets near to a new release a note will be placed here, that you can test the new dev beta.
Currently there is no beta available.


Wiki
====

All documentation moved to the [wiki page](https://github.com/NicoHood/HID/wiki).

An offline snapshot is available in [releases](https://github.com/NicoHood/HID/releases).

TODO
====

Under Construction. This is a todo list for myself.

```
Keyboard Layout for different Languages
Clean up USB Core code from fixed values. Use better understandable definitions
Magic key fix for 32u4?

keycode/raw for keyboard
Check Keyboard keycode function again? + add example
Generalize HID key definitions via HIDTables for example?

Test with Android phone (HL1)
HID-Bridge + Firmwares (planned for 2.2)

HL2 usb hub fix (try with a bare cdc bootloader?)
```
